            <p>Copenhagen is a bustling city with many attractions and amenities. However, finding a place to park can be a challenge for both locals and tourists alike. According to the parking data provided by the city government in the past ten years [1], illegal occupation of parking spaces due to excessive traffic has always been a common phenomenon, with an average of more than 50 illegal occupations per street. In the past two years, the number of illegal parking has increased by about 240% compared with ten years ago. How to find a legal parking space that is easy to find in the city is a problem we need to focus on.</p>

            <p>This is the distribution of average parking occupancy rates for the seven districts of Copenhagen at 12:00, 17:00 and 22:00. The counting of parking spaces at 12:00 does not represent a real-time record of parking at that time, because most car owners need to occupy the parking spaces early, so we regard the data at 12:00 as the occupancy of parking spaces in the morning peak.</p>

            <p>It is obvious that the most congested area in the morning rush hour is the city_center (illegal parking on the street will cause road congestion, a vicious circle). Moreover, the phenomenon of illegal parking is likely to cause a negative mentality in drivers. They will end up looking for parking spaces for too much time and end up imitating others to park in illegal parking spaces. Generally speaking, the morning rush hour in the urban area is the period with the largest traffic flow, but it is interesting that "Amager", "Norrobro", and "Vesterbro/Kongens Enghave" have achieved a lower occupancy rate in the morning, and as the day progresses In the past, the occupancy rates will gradually increase. For people who need to park at the evening peak, these three areas need special attention.</p> 
            <h1>Which streets are easier for us to find parking spaces in the "hardest-hit area" city_center? </h1>
            <p>The data points in the figure below represent the parking occupancy rate of each street in different periods, and the red line is the prediction curve using the weighted average regression of the three data. From the figure, we selected the 5 streets that are most likely to get parking spaces during the morning peak hours: "Silkegade", "Sankt Pauls Plads", "Haregade", "Gammeltorv", "Klarebodeme". (Occupancy rates are both below 50%) </p>

        <p class="fifty_p">Although the data at 12:00 is generally slightly higher than that at 17:00 and 22:00, some streets are labeled as "the least chance of finding a parking space" even though they are at the back end of the icon, but because of the difference between morning and evening conditions is large, it is difficult for the average to represent them, such as "Palægade", "Sankt Pauls Gade", "Rigensgade" and "Admiralgade". Their occupancy may be as high as 200% in the morning peak but closer to 25% in the evening.</p> </p>

            <p>In order to observe the parking space occupancy more intuitively, this tool allows you to choose to view the situation of each street on the map (the default is 12:00) and annotate the probability of getting a parking space on the specific street while clicking it.</p>

        <p>Here we did not analyze the relationship between the difficulty and ease of parking spaces and other factors because the sampling time interval of the data set is too long (two times on year) which could lead to too many uncertainties. However, we still got a lot of information and valuable results.</p>
